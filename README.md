Web Application Development Final Project

This web application allows a student to sign-up, add, delete, and edit college courses. Teachers will have the ability to add and delete courses as well.


Students should be able to navigate and search out classes either based on the course name or number. Students should have the ability to sign in, sign out,
and register users. The students should be able to add the classes to their own schedule so that they know which classes they are taking.
They should also be able to view a screen with all of the classes they are currently signed up for. The students should also be able to delete or drop a class.
